Smart contract developed by [Cyril CASTAGNET](https://github.com/lecascyril)

# Getting started
## Dependencies

- NodeJS

## Installation

```js
// Truffle
npm install -g truffle
```
```js
// Install packages
npm install
```

## Launch tests

```js
// Launch Ganache (in a separate terminal)
ganache
```

```js
// Compile and deploy the smart contract
truffle migrate
```

```js
// Run tests
truffle test
```

# Voting system unit tests project
Pour réaliser les tests, j'ai choisi classer les tests à l'aide de **describe** dans des sections qui reprennent la même structure que le smart contract :

### GETTERS

- getVoter
- getOneProposal

### REGISTRATION

- addVoter

### PROPOSAL

- addProposal

### VOTE

- setVote

### STATE

- startProposalsRegistering
- endProposalsRegistering
- startVotingSession
- endVotingSession
- tallyVotes

Pour chaque méthode, je teste le ou les **modifier**, puis les **require** un par un, ensuite le coeur de la **fonction** qui peut effectuer une ou plusieurs actions, et pour finir les éventuels **event**.
\
Des commentaires ont été ajoutés avant chaque bloc de test afin de se repérer plus facilement.

Voici la sortie console des tests effectués :

```java

Enfin j'ai ajouté le package **eth-gas-reporter** afin d'avoir un apercu du coût en gas du déploiement et de chaque fonctions. J'ai ajouté quelques options afin de visualiser le coût en dollar, mais je les ai volontairement commentées car cela nécéssite une clé API.
